# Crystal Quest

## Project Overview

- Designed and developed a 3D third-person platformer game in Unreal Engine using Blueprint, with a structured level progression from safe zones to increasingly challenging enemy encounters.
- Created a smooth onboarding experience in the base area with no enemies, allowing players to practice movement and jumping while collecting coins for bonus points.
- Built intuitive level guidance using visual cues like coins, terrain structure, and wind streams to direct players without needing a minimap or explicit UI.
- Implemented AI enemies with distinct behaviors:
  - *Patrolling guards* in the town
  - *Mortar defenses* guarding fortress towers
  - *Vision-based wizards* in the forest, requiring stealth and strategy
- Created a mechanic where the player can jump on enemies to defeat them, introducing risk-reward combat alongside stealth.
- Added health packs placed in strategic locations to encourage exploration and recovery after encounters.
- Developed core systems including health, coin collection, and failure-reset logic, with a final victory screen showing total time and coins collected.
- Balanced gameplay to support stealth, combat, and exploration-based strategies for varied playstyles.
