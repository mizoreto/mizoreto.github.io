## Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for forecasting the future motion of an ego vehicle in complex multi-agent driving scenarios. Built with PyTorch and trained on a modified version of the Argoverse 2 Motion Forecasting Dataset, the model was developed for a [Kaggle-hosted course challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cse-251-b-2025).

Our model is inspired by the [ADAPT](https://kuis-ai.github.io/adapt/) architecture, and designed to handle long-horizon trajectory prediction by encoding temporal and social context. Specifically, we:

- Use bidirectional LSTM to encode past trajectories for all agents
- Apply multi-head self-attention to model agent-agent interactions
- Predict a coarse future endpoint, refine it, and condition trajectory generation on it
- Detach gradients between stages for training stability

We trained our model on agent-centric motion features: position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), heading angle, and object type. **No map-based information (such as HD lanes, semantic raster, or traffic light states) was provided**, highlighting the modelâ€™s ability to perform under minimal context assumptions.
